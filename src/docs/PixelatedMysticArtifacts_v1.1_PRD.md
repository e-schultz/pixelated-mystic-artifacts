- No memory-related crashes on supported devices
- Reduction in reported performance degradation over time

### 6. Safari Rendering Artifact Fixes

**Business Need**: Safari users experience visual artifacts and rendering inconsistencies.

**Requirements**:
- Fix transparent element rendering issues on Safari
- Resolve canvas scaling problems on Retina displays
- Address Safari-specific animation timing issues
- Fix text rendering inconsistencies in ASCII mode

**Technical Approach**:
- Implement browser-specific rendering paths where necessary
- Use feature detection for Safari-specific optimizations
